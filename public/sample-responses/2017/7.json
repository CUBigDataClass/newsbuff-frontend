Though rumors of Harris gearing up for a presidential run in 2020 are becoming noisier by the minute (when Stephen Colbert asked her on Thursday if she would run, Harris coyly said, \u201cI might\u201d), she told me the memoir is not meant to help lay the groundwork for such a campaign. \u201cAt the expense of sounding immodest,\u201d she said, the book is \u201creally about the work I\u2019ve done already that\u2019s had national impact, and what I hope to come from it.\u201d Below, Harris talks about how she connects personal experiences to her professional life, the breakneck speed of the news cycle, the inspiration she takes from Bob Marley and more.",
