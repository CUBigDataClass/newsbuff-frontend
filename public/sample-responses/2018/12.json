It was still there by midafternoon, drifting on the thermals over the mostly depopulated National Mall, wheeling occasionally past the window in the hallway outside the office where the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, sat on the 20th day of what would soon become the longest government shutdown in American history.",

While taking a break from a tedious data-entry job, I stepped outside onto a fire escape to find a dun-brown spider dangling at eye level from the wrought iron. Ordinarily I would have swatted it away with a wave of the arm. But something about this creature persuaded me to stop and observe as she traversed back and forth between stair and balustrade, constructing an elaborate death trap. From frame to completion, the spider\u2019s labor took about an hour, and I scrutinized the whole thing, entranced \u2014 which might help explain why I was sacked later that week.",
