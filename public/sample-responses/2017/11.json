            "description": "The Trump administration has been clear about its view of China. A 2017 national security strategy document called China a \u201crevisionist\u201d power attempting to reorder international politics to suit its interests. It\u2019s difficult to think otherwise given Beijing\u2019s military buildup, its attempts to undermine American influence and power, its retaliations against American allies such as Canada, and its economic actions.",

            "description": "Sheikh Hasina has done marvels for Bangladesh over nearly 10 consecutive years as prime minister. Per-capita income in what was one of the poorest and least developed countries in the world has grown by nearly 150 percent, and the proportion of the population living in extreme poverty has dropped from 19 percent to about 9 percent. All the greater the pity that her achievements have been offset by a precipitous slide toward authoritarianism and an election in which Mrs. Hasina\u2019s party won 288 of the 300 contested seats in Parliament, a preposterous 96 percent rate of victory.",
