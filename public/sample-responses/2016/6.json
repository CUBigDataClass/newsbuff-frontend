The stone-tiled floor was her runway. Brides, grooms and their family and friends, who sat on the faux lime green leather banquettes, became her spectators. A red rose bouquet was in one hand; a blue marriage certificate folder in her other.",

It is necessarily incomplete as many local officials refuse to confirm casualty information. The toll here does not generally include claims of insurgents killed by the government, because of the difficulty of verifying such claims. Similarly, the reports do not include attacks on the government claimed by the Taliban. Both sides routinely inflate casualties of their opponents. ",
