So starting Sunday,  he will run an evening dessert bar in an Upper West Side pastry shop, R\u00e9colte. It will be open Wednesdays through Sundays, starting at 7 p.m., after the shop closes. Three courses of elegantly fashioned sweets, like a version of s\u2019mores with smoked chocolate, marshmallow and a graham cracker; or a verrine of passion fruit and chocolate in a glass, are $23. There\u2019s also a savory cheese plate. Coffee, tea, chocolate and fruit drinks will be served, but as of now, no alcohol.",
